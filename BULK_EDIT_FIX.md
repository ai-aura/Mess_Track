# Bulk Edit Feature - Fix Summary

## Issue
The bulk edit feature on the Weekly page was not working.

## Root Cause
The bulk edit functionality was incomplete:
1. Missing event listeners for bulk edit buttons
2. Missing bulk edit functions (toggleBulkEditMode, toggleDaySelect, bulkSelectAll, etc.)
3. Inline onclick handlers that weren't properly connected
4. Missing modal initialization call

## Changes Made

### 1. app.js - Added Event Listeners (Lines 273-313)

- **bulkSelectNone()** - Clears all selections
- **bulkMarkMeal(type)** - Marks lunch, dinner, or both for all selected days
